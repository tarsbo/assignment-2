				<p>This pool was established 15 years ago and we are incredibly proud of what it has come to be today. Safety and cleanliness are always considered at Watercrest Pool. You will find that not only are our lifeguards qualified, but they are also incredibly friendly! If you're looking for a different way of exercising, are teaching your child to swim, or are even trying to plan a family outing, Watercrest Community Pool can make it happen! We have a variety of pools to suit your needs and we hope to see you soon!</p>
